Recent archaeological excavations at Selsey have uncovered Roman artifacts that directly connect to Edward Heron-Allen's early 20th-century research at the same site.

The discovery includes Roman coins, pottery fragments, and bronze implements that match descriptions in Heron-Allen's field notes from his 1911 excavations at "The Mound." What makes this particularly significant is that several artifacts appear to complete sets that Heron-Allen had partially uncovered over a century ago.

Dr. Sarah Mitchell, lead archaeologist on the project, noted: "Heron-Allen's meticulous documentation has proven invaluable. His sketches and measurements have helped us identify fragments that might otherwise have been overlooked."

The find reinforces Heron-Allen's reputation as a careful and systematic researcher, whose work continues to inform modern archaeological practices. The artifacts will be displayed at the Novium Museum in Chichester, alongside Heron-Allen's original field notes and sketches.
