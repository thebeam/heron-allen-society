International scholars have begun a comprehensive re-examination of Edward Heron-Allen's translations of Persian poetry, particularly his groundbreaking work on Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat.

Professor Reza Aslan of Tehran University, leading the research team, has discovered previously unknown variant readings in manuscripts that Heron-Allen consulted but never published. These findings suggest that Heron-Allen's scholarly approach was even more sophisticated than previously understood.

The research has revealed that Heron-Allen corresponded with Persian scholars of his time, seeking authenticity and accuracy in his translations. His method of comparing multiple manuscript sources and consulting native speakers was revolutionary for Victorian-era Oriental studies.

"Heron-Allen's approach anticipated modern comparative textual analysis by several decades," notes Professor Aslan. "His unpublished notes show a level of scholarly rigor that was exceptional for his time."

The complete findings will be published in a special issue of the Journal of Persian Literature, with implications for how we understand Victorian engagement with Eastern texts.
