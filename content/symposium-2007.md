### Details

**Lady Margaret Hall** (Tel: 01865 274300) is immediately north of the Oxford Parks. From whichever direction you are coming to Oxford, it is best to reach LMH from the northern end of the Oxford Ring Road; the city centre is difficult to navigate unless you already know exactly where you are going. Detailed directions can be found on the LMH website. Limited parking is available at a fee of Â£20 for the duration of the Symposium, please contact the Chairman.

Those travelling by train are strongly advised to take a taxi to the college. It is a very long walk. Numbers and car registrations are required 7 days prior to the start of the Symposium and drivers are asked to report to the Porter's Lodge on arrival so that they can be advised where to park. The college is able to provide overnight accommodation either for the night before or the night after the Symposium, or both. Coffee and a finger buffet will be provided at the Symposium. It is important that all those wishing to attend inform the Secretary before 23 June.
