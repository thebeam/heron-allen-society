Presented here for the first time in a single volume, is the entire  corpus of short fiction by Edward Heron-Allen, one of England’s most  intriguing, and unnecessarily obscure, authors. From "The Suicide of  Sylvester Gray," the novella which was an inspiration for The Portrait  of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde, a friend of Heron-Allen's, to “The  Cheetah Girl,” an outrageous masterpiece of biological science fiction,  the present collection is a tour de force of the elegant, the bizarre,  and the unmentionable.

With a total of thirty tales, the five volumes contained herein, many  of which have previously only been obtainable for exorbitant prices,  is available in a proper format for connoisseurs, and the  unafraid.
