Recent research has uncovered new details about Edward Heron-Allen's remarkable violin collection, including his own handmade instruments and rare acquisitions from master craftsmen.

The collection, which includes violins made by Heron-Allen himself, represents one of the most significant private collections of the Victorian era. His expertise in violin-making led to the publication of his seminal work "Violin-Making, as it was and is" in 1884.

New archival materials suggest that Heron-Allen's influence on violin craftsmanship extended far beyond his published works, with correspondence recently discovered showing his mentorship of several notable violin makers of his time.

This discovery adds another layer to our understanding of Heron-Allen's polymathic interests and his dedication to preserving traditional craftsmanship in an era of industrial change.
