**March**

The Annual Heron-Allen Lecture was held in Talbot Hall, Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford on Friday 6 March 2009 at 5.15, preceded by a reception in The Old Library.

The lecture was delivered by Professor E J Milner-Gulland, Professor in Conservation Science, Imperial College London. Professor Milner-Gulland will speak about "Conserving the Saiga Antelope: Science in a changing world". The underlying theme of her work is the interaction between the population dynamics of exploited species and the incentives experienced by the people who hunt them. She is chair of The Saiga Conservation Alliance (SCA), a network of scientists and conservationists working to save the critically endangered saiga antelope from imminent extinction.

The Heron-Allen Lecture is given annually in honour of Armorel Daphne Heron-Allen (1926), who died shortly after receiving a first class degree in Natural Sciences (Zoology). A scholarship in Life Sciences and a travel grant are awarded each year in her name.
