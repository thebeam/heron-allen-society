**October**

In a report for the Curl-Rin Challenge Fund Application, the London Library stated that their Heron-Allen Collection had very largely been added to the on-line catalogue, but had been kept as a separate collection. Edward Heron-Allen (1861-1943) bequeathed his collection of edition of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat in English, Persian and many other languages, together with critical works on the poet (c400 items in total). All books in the collection are post-1850 publications and most have their original bindings. This collection reflects the scholarly interest in Omar Khayyam from the 1890s to the 1920s, and the bound volumes of notes and letters written to Heron-Allen by other translators and authors interested in Khayyam are of especial significance. Details of these have been included in the catalogue records, as have provenance and binding notes when appropriate. The collection also includes Heron-Allen's own manuscript notes for his edition of the Rubaiyat, as well as a unique collection of ten portfolios of pamphlets, ephemera and cuttings relating to him. Other editions of the Rubaiyat acquired by the Library have been added tro the original collection. Heron-Allen also gave collections - reflecting his other interests as a musician and marine biologist - to the Royal College of Music and the Natural History Museum.

*Chichester History*, no.22 (October 2006), p.18 includes some reminiscences by Fred Robinson, entitled 'Edward Heron-Allen, Polymath', inspired by the Chairman's talk to the Chichester Local History Society in March 2006.
