*The new plaque hung outside Large Acres in Selsey*

Members will recall the Heron-Allen Plaque unveiling at Selsey on 15 July 2002 (described in *Newsletter no.3*). Your committee failed to check out the blue plaque unveiled outside Large Acres to the extent, and their eternal shame, that the letters 'FRS' were omitted from it. It was thought essential that this should be corrected: accordingly, the work was put in hand.

The new plaque has been manufactured and was put in place on the 15th of October, 2005.
