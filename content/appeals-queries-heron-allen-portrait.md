*Heron-Allen portrait*

The painter of the portrait of Edward Heron-Allen that Ivor Jones has kindly allowed us to reproduce is unknown. All that is known about the portrait is that it was exhibited at the Paris Exhibition in 1927. The Society is anxious to identify the artist and any suggestions will be gratefully received by the Committee.
