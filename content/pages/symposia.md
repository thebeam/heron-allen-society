## Symposia

The Society holds an annual symposium at venues such as the Natural History Museum, the Royal College of Music or the Allen Room, St. Anne's Soho, in London; Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford and the West Sussex Record Office at Chichester.

It meets occasionally for one-off events such as the unveiling of a plaque to Edward Heron-Allen in Selsey, the Day Conference on the Clare Island Survey in Dublin in October 2009 and the recent centenary visit to Clare Island in August 2011.

Many of the talks are published by the Society in the Opuscula.

## International Symposia

Following our highly successful international symposium at the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin in 2009, we decided to arrange an annual holiday in a location especially associated with the life and work of Edward Heron-Allen.

The intention was to increase our knowledge of Heron-Allen, to travel to interesting locations, to enjoy a holiday and to get to know our fellow members rather better.

Making use of his detailed holiday diaries, which are now deposited in the West Sussex Record Office at Chichester, we have arranged the following symposia:

- [The Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, Ireland 2009](/posts/royal-irish-academy-dublin-2009.html)
- Clare Island, Ireland, 2011
- Ajaccio and Bastia, Corsica, 2013
- Venice and Verona, Italy, 2014
- Modena, Bologna and Ravenna, Italy, 2015
- La Rochelle, France, 2016
- Pisa and Florence, Italy, 2017
- Mulranny, Inishbofin and Galway, Ireland, 2018
- Biarritz and Pau, France, 2019
