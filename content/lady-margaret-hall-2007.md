In his "Notes upon the Literary, Scientific, and Artistic Activities of Edward Heron-Allen, FRS" (Heron-Allen Society, Opusculum I (2000), EH-A wrote that after he lost his younger daughter Armorel Daphne in a car accident, within a fortnight of her having taken her degree (with first class honours) in Science, at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford: he founded in her memory '"The Armorel Holiday Gift" of Â£60 a year, and the "Armorel Daphne Heron-Allen Scholarship" in Science at 300 a year'. Lady Margaret Hall, confirm that both funds continue to bear fruit. The Armorel Daphne Heron-Allen Scholarship is awarded annually to an outstanding student in the life sciences, while the Heron-Allen travel grant is awarded annually to a student with a good project. Grants to enable students to take a holiday are also awarded. A more recent innovation is the annual Heron-Allen lecture. Three have been held so far, to co-incide with the election of the Heron-Allen Scholar.

This year the Heron-Allen Lecture will be held at Lady Margaret Hall on Friday 2 March 2007. The speaker is Professor Georgina Mace FRS, the Director of Science at the Institute of Zoology in London. Professor Mace is renowned for her work in conservation biology, in particular for identifying criteria to rank species according to their risk of extinction. In a talk entitled 'Biodiversity, ecosystems and human well-being' she will discuss the evidence that we are rapidly losing biodiversity on a global scale, the implications that this has for people, and some possible solutions. The Lecture will be held in Talbot Hall, Lady Margaret Hall, at 5.15pm. There is no charge for admission. Bookings can be made through the [LMH Website](http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/Home.aspx).
