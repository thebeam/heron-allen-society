Request for help:

A colleague has recently bought a letter to EH-A from Gilbert James, the well-known book illustrator. In it, James offers to sell the originals of his pictures for the 1907 Foulis edition of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.

Does anyone recall hearing anything about those pictures or, better still, remember seeing them at Large Acres, or anywhere else?

Any assistance would be welcome.

Please send any information to Garry Garrard (*gagarrard@lineone.net*)
