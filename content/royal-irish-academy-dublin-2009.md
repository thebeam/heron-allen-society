**Dublin, Ireland**

The Heron-Allen Society held its first international symposium at the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin in October 2009, marking a significant expansion of the Society's activities beyond the UK.

This groundbreaking event explored Edward Heron-Allen's connections to Ireland and his involvement in Irish academic and cultural circles. The symposium was particularly significant as it examined Heron-Allen's participation in the Clare Island Survey, which had important implications for Irish marine biology and natural history.

### Programme Highlights

The symposium featured presentations on:
- Heron-Allen's contribution to the Clare Island Survey of 1909-1911
- His correspondence with Irish scholars and naturalists
- The impact of his foraminiferal research on Irish marine science
- Cultural connections between Heron-Allen and Irish literary figures

### Legacy

This successful international symposium established the precedent for the Society's annual international symposia, which became a beloved tradition, taking members to locations across Europe that were significant in Edward Heron-Allen's life and travels.

The Dublin symposium demonstrated the international scope of Heron-Allen's influence and the global interest in his polymathic contributions to science, literature, and culture.
