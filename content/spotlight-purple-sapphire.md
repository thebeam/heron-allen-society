After decades of speculation, new research has finally revealed the true origins of Edward Heron-Allen's infamous "cursed" purple sapphire, currently housed in the Natural History Museum's vault.

The sapphire, which Heron-Allen claimed brought misfortune to its owners, has been the subject of numerous investigations. Recent archival work has uncovered the full provenance chain, tracing the gem's journey from its discovery in Ceylon to its arrival in Heron-Allen's collection.

What's particularly fascinating is the discovery of Heron-Allen's detailed correspondence with gemologists of his era, revealing his scientific approach to studying what he termed "the stone's malevolent influence" on its various owners.

The research also reveals Heron-Allen's role in establishing protocols for the scientific study of allegedly cursed objects, a methodology that influenced museum practices well into the 20th century.
