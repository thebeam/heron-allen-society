Talks were givem by Tim Collins on 'Praeger and the Natural History Societies in Ireland' and by Tim McCann on 'Flappers and Foraminiferists on Clare Island'. We were able to visit Granuille's Castle and McCabe's, where Heron-Allen stayed in 1911, and reconstruct some of his photographs. We were richly entertained by the islanders and at the Bayview Hotel and O'Grady Guest House.

Some of the programme can still be seen on the internet. For the full interview with John Whittaker, go to 'Museum Secrets', then 'Episode 5 - Cursed Amethyst' and he can be seen in the video segment entitled 'unexplained evidence'.
