## July

9 July. The Society's 20th Annual Symposium will be held at St. Peter's Church Hall, Selsey, on Saturday 9 July starting at 11.00. The theme is *'Fossils, Monsters and Roman Heads.* The programme will include Julian Munby FSA on 'Chichester and Selsey Landscapes' and other papers to be arranged. This will be followed by a late lunch at the Seal Hotel, Selsey. After lunch, David Bone will lead the Society on a walk entitled 'Views of Selsey Past. Geology and Coastal Change through the eyes of Heron-Allen'. To book for the Symposium please e-mail our Honorary Secretary, Juliet Field at jools.fielf@btinternet.com by 21 June. Lunch reservations must be made before then as we have to order food in advance. We hope to include a short musical interlude on the EH-A organ in St Peter's Church, with Kate Adcock.

## August

Following the recent death of our Chairman Tim McCann, we regret that the Society is currently unable to answer any requests for information relating to Heron-Allen researches. We will update the website when we have further news on this.
