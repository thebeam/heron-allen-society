By kind permission of Pat Naismith we were able to see one of the two violins made by Heron-Allen and to hear it being played. We also heard the song, 'The Ballade of my Lady's Glance' composed by Edward Heron-Allen and selections from 'In a Persian Garden' composed by Liza Lehmann, Edward Heron-Allen's sister-in-law]
